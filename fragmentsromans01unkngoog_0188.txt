The Noctes Atticae ol Aulus Gellius is a representative work,
since it not only reflects periectly the nature ol the subjects which
engaged the attention oi the literary men oi the second century A.D.,
but also lorcibly depicts the spirit in which their labors were prosecuted.
Ol especial interest and value are the numerous quotations from early
writers whose works are no longer extant. For such portions as yet
remain oi the oldest Latin literature, we are almost wholly indebted to
quotations by various grammarians. In this connection the obligations
ol Latin scholarship to Gellius are iar irom small. Fully two hundred and
seventy-five authors are mentioned or directly quoted in his work, while
the number ol individual works cited is twice or thrice as large. In
giving these quotations irom the older writers, he olten adds inlormation
concerning their careers, or their¹ works, and in this way his contribu-
tions to our knowledge oi the history ol Latin literature is very
valuable. For example, practically all that is known ol the lile oi
Plautus, the greatest comie poet oi Rome, is derived from the third
chapter ol the third book ol the Noctes Atticae.

The commentary gives sufficient assistance to enable such students
to read the selections as rapidly and intelligently as possible, and
without the need ol any helps beyond those lurnished by the book itsell.
The text, in point oi language and spelling, is in the main that ol
Hertz, as given in his critical edition. Throughout the book all vowels
known to be long have been carelully marked.
