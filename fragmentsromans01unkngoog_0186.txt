This work is designed as a text-book ior the use of
students in Universities and colleges, and also to furnish
an account of this branch of archaeological study for
general readers. It has been prepared in the belief that a
knowledge of epigraphy forms an essential part oi the
equipment of a teacher oi the classics, and that the sub·
ject itseif has become so important as to justify its intro-
duction, in elementary iorm at least, into the curriculum
of undergraduate studies.

A distinctive feature of the book is the number and
character of its illustrations,—there being over seven
hundred cuts and diagrams of inscriptions, for the purpose
of illustrating the text, and for practice in reading. Of
these, over one hundred are photographis reproductions,
showing the forms of the letters and the arrangement of
the inscriptions. The work is also supplied with an
exhaustive bibliography and valuable tables oi abbrevia·
tions, archaisms, etc.
