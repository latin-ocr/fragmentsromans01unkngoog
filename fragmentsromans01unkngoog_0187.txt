Harkness's Standard Latin Grammar represents the best classifica-
tion and arrangement of the facts of the language. It is a Grammar of
the Latin language, based upon the facts of that language, not on
“comparative grammar ”; but the facts and laws of the language are
all presented in the light of the latest and best grammatical studies,
including comparative grammar.

The principles and facts are presented in clear and simple language.
The work has been pronounced ¹·a model for perspicuity of statement
and clearness ol arrangement.” It is characterized by strict accuracy
of statement.

It is very much more comprehensive than any of its competitors. It
practically embraces three works in one:

It is pre-eminently a grammar for schools. The part intended to
be learned is printed in large type and is kept distinct from other parts
ol the work. It is made as brief, clear, and simple as possible.

It is a full and trustworthy grammar for the advanced student. It
accordingly contains a large amount of valuable information intended for
reference, and presented in the most convenient form for that purpose.

It is a practical introduction to philological study based upon the
Latin. This part of the work is kept distinct by being placed in foot-
notes. Abundant references are made to the latest and best authorities
on the numerous linguistic questions which now interest the classical
scholar.
